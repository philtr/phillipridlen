# What are you doing?

_This is [a now page][now]. If you have your own site, [you should make
one][now], too._

When Twitter first arrived on the scene, it had one mission: answer the
question, "What are you doing?" Twitter no longer serves that purpose for most
of its users, and as such, a better place to keep up with me is to watch this page.
This is what I'm doing as of February 2020.

## Family

I [recently adopted][legacy] a beautiful one-year-old girl on February 21, 2020.
I live in Burleson, Texas (just south of Fort Worth) with my wife and our
three kids aged [5][bennett], [4][hudson], and [1][legacy]. Interesting fact:
my youngest two share a birthday!

## Employment

I'm currently happily employed as  a Lead Software Engineer at [Stitch
Fix][stitchfix].  It's a fantastic place to work: competitive compensation,
interesting challenges to solve with a great deal of autonomy, great benefits,
and a serious commitment to life/work balance.

I work remotely on the Payments team, where I (among other things) ensure that
you are charged the correct amount for your orders. No more, no less. Our tech
stack is mostly Ruby on Rails, with a smattering of Go and React. You should
come [work with me][careers]!

I'm not seeking other employement or contract work at this time. Please do not
solicit me for open positions.

## Extra-curriculars

I wrangled the [RubyFTW Fort Worth Ruby Enthusiasts Group][fwrb] for a number of
years, but I hung my hat, and eventually that group was put out to pasture.

I'm still the [youth leader][youth] at [Burleson Bible Church][bbc] where I
mentor and teach students in grades 7 through 12. Yes, I still laugh at fart
jokes.  Because they are funny.

I completed my [first trail 10K in September 2019][roughcreek], and I'm training
for an [8-mile trail run][coyote] on April 18th.
