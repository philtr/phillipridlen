<h1>Beef Burgundy Stew - Instant Pot</h1>
<p>From https://realplans.com</p>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 1/2 pounds beef stew meat</li>
<li>2 onions</li>
<li>12 small potatoes, golf ball size</li>
<li>4 carrots</li>
<li>1 teaspoon coarse sea salt, plus more to taste</li>
<li>4 cups sliced mushrooms</li>
<li>4 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
<li>2 cups red wine</li>
<li>3 bay leaves</li>
<li>1 bunch fresh thyme</li>
<li>1 1/2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
<li>3 tablespoons water</li>
</ul>
<h3>HOW TO PREPARE</h3>
<ol>
<li>Turn on Sauté mode for pressure cooker. Cut stew meat into 1 1/2 inch cubes. Peel and quarter onions. Slice potatoes in half. Peel carrots and cut into 1-inch chunks.</li>
<li>Add beef and salt to the Instant Pot and brown beef on all sides. Stop Sauté mode.</li>
<li>Add onions, mushrooms, potatoes, carrots, garlic, wine, and bay leaves.</li>
<li>Tie half of thyme with a string and add to the pressure cooker. Remove leaves from remaining thyme stems, chop, and reserve for garnish.</li>
<li>Place lid on pressure cooker, seal, and cook for 35 minutes. Once cooking is complete, you can quick release pressure or natural release.</li>
<li>Remove meat and vegetables from pressure cooker and place together in a separate dish.</li>
<li>Turn Sauté mode back on and begin simmering. In a small cup, whisk cornstarch and water to make a slurry. Pour about a third of this liquid into the sauce and simmer for a minute or two. Add more slurry if you wish to have a thicker sauce, but go easy as too much will make your sauce too gelatinous.</li>
<li>Season the sauce with sea salt, then pour it over the meat and vegetables.</li>
<li>Serve stew garnished with thyme.</li>
</ol>
