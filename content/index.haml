          Hi, there! I'm a software engineer weaving code at [Stitch
          Fix](http://stitchfix.com). Before that I was baking up awesome digital
          treats at [Oven Bits](http://ovenbits.com) in Dallas.

          I occasionally [write a note or two](/notes/) on topics I'm passionate
          about. I'm also the youth director at [Burleson Bible
          Church](http://burlesonbible.org) for students in 7th-12th grade. I
          apologize in advance for the fart jokes.

          I previously organized [Ruby FTW](http://rubyftw.org), the Ruby enthuisast group
          of Fort Worth, Texas, but have since passed the torch on to others.

%section.posts
  %p.intro
    I don't write often or very much. Many of the following articles are barely
    more than links to other, better articles, and the rest are short and
    unpolished. Read at your own risk. ;)

  .posts-categories
    - posts_grouped_by_category.each do |category, posts|
      .posts-category
        %h3.header-link{ id: category }
          = link_to category, "##{category}"
        %ul.posts-list
          - posts.each do |post|
            %li
              = link_to post.attributes[:title], post
              %aside
                %time{ datetime: post[:date].strftime("%Y-%m-%d"), title: post[:date].strftime("%A, %B %-d, %Y") }
                  = post[:date].year
