<div class="intro">
I lost my iPhone 6S in January while I was on business in San Francisco. I
needed a way to get a Lyft to SFO, so I stopped by the T-Mobile store and picked
up a T-Mobile REVVL (Alcatel 5049W) for less than $200. I assumed it would be so
miserable that I would immediately start saving for a new iPhone. I was suprised
to find out that my new low-end Android device was completely tolerable and that
there were actually a few things about it that I prefer to iOS. And I was even
more suprised to find that the things I liked about it were not necessarily the
things I expected.

## Things I Like

- Notification model
  - You don't "lose" notifications
- Customizeability
- Extensibility
  - SMS, Dialer, Homescreen app integration
- Distinction between _vibrate_ and _silent_.

## Things I thought I would like, but don't use

- Rooted OS
- Widgets
- Arbitrary Homescreen Icon Arrangement
- Game Console Emulators

## Things I don't like

- Oversized application title bars
- Can't make UI text small enough for my liking
- I've spent a lot of money in the Apple Ecosystem and I don't want to spend it
    again
- Notification model has its downsides
  - Not losing notifications means that I also miss things
