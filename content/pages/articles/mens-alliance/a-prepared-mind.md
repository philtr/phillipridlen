**1 Peter 1:13–16 (LEB):**

> 13&nbsp;Therefore, when you have prepared your minds for action by self-controlled, put your hope completely in the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 14&nbsp;As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former desires you used to conform to your ignorance, 15&nbsp;but as the one who called you is holy, you yourselves be holy in all your conduct, 16&nbsp;for it is written, "You will be holy, because I am."

The Apostle Peter wrote these words to men who were scattered throughout the known world and were likely facing hardships and opposition. Like us, they lived in a world that pressured them to conform—to compromise integrity, chase comfort, and avoid standing for truth. Peter's challenge to them is just as relevant to us today.

First, **get your mind ready for battle**. The phrase Peter used was literally "gird up the loins of your mind"—get dressed for battle, mentally and spiritually. The way we do this is by being self-controlled. Your bible probably uses the phrase "sober minded", but this is about more than just avoiding drinking too much alcohol—it's about clear, disciplined thinking. When substances or emotions cloud our thinking, we are not ready. Once we have prepared our minds, we can rest easy knowing that we do not fight this battle alone.

🤔 **What distractions or weaknesses are keeping you from being ready or resting in the hope of Jesus? How often do we let emotions, lust, or laziness cloud our judgment?**

Second, **don't conform**. We talk a lot about being "Barbarian Ambassadors"—we use the term "Barbarian" loosely here, meaning that we don't conform to the prevailing culture, men who refuse to be tamed by the world’s standards, men who reject passivity, stand firm in truth, and live with conviction. Don't cave to that pressure from the culture that we face just like the Christian men in the first century Roman Empire. These men probably had even greater pressure than in our day—they faced imprisonment or even death! Later on in this letter, Peter urges them to live a set apart life so that the only slander that sticks is the slander they receive for doing what is right and honorable (1 Peter 2:11-12).

🤔 **Where in your life do you need to stop conforming and start standing apart? What’s one action you can take this week to prepare your mind for battle? Who in your tribe will hold you accountable?**

🙏 *Lord, help us to prepare our minds, to stay clear-headed, and to pursue holiness. Make us men who lead by example in a world that desperately needs strong, godly men. In Jesus' name, Amen.*
