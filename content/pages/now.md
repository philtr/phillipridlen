# What are you doing?

_This is [a now page][now]. If you have your own site, [you should make
one][now], too._

When ~~Twitter~~ X first arrived on the scene, it had one mission: answer the
question, "What are you doing?" It has instead become a cesspool of hot takes
and pot shots at others. You won't find me posting there; instead, I try to
keep this page up to date with the important highlights of what I'm up to.

This is what I'm doing as of January 15, 2024.

## 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦<small style="font-size: 0.6rem">👧🏾</small> &nbsp;Family

I'm still living in Burleson, Texas (just south of Fort Worth) with my wife and
three kids.  Working from home for the past several years has been a huge
blessing; I've been able to be there for the big moments and the tough times.
I'm able to greet my kids when they come home from school and help them with
various things throughout the day. The random hugs and surprise meeting crashes
are always fun.

I'll never go back to working in an office full time. At least until my kids are
older and want nothing to do with me. 😅

## 👨‍💻 &nbsp;Work

I work as a software engineer at [BILL] keeping the authentication and identity
systems up and running smoothly. I've really enjoyed learning and using the
[Elixir] programming language, even though before this position I used [Ruby]
pretty much exclusively.

## ⛪️ &nbsp;Church

I'm actively involved at [Burleson Bible Church][bbc]:

- I serve as an [elder] to lead the church and care for the flock
- I'm the [youth leader][youth] where I mentor and teach students in grades 7 through 12
- I lead our [Men's Alliance Tribe][alliance] tribe to get men out of isolation
- I serve in the music ministry playing various instruments as needed
