# What are you doing?

_This is [a now page][now]. If you have your own site, [you should make
one][now], too._

When Twitter first arrived on the scene, it had one mission: answer the
question, "What are you doing?" Twitter no longer serves that purpose for most
of its users, and as such, a better place to keep up with me is to watch this page.

This is what I'm doing as of January 26, 2022

## 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦<small style="font-size: 0.6rem">👧🏾</small> &nbsp;Family

I'm still living in Burleson, Texas (just south of Fort Worth) with my wife and
three kids.  Working from home for the past several years has been a huge
blessing; I've been able to be there for the big moments and the tough times.
I'm able to greet my kids when they come home from school and help them with
various things throughout the day. The random hugs and surprise meeting crashes
are always fun.

I'll never go back to working in an office full time. At least until my kids are
older and want nothing to do with me. 😅

## 👨‍💻 &nbsp;Work

I started a new role as a software engineer at [Divvy] at the end of
January 2022.  I'm both excited and nervous to be using a new programming
language ([Elixir]), since I've used Ruby pretty much exclusively for my entire
career.

## ⛪️ &nbsp;Church

I'm still the [youth leader][youth] at [Burleson Bible Church][bbc] where I
mentor and teach students in grades 7 through 12. I also serve in the music
ministry where I primarily play bass guitar, but occasionally acoustic guitar,
electric guitar, and keyboard. I'm solidly mediocre at every instrument I play.
Except drums. I'm actually just bad at those.
