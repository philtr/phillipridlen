# What are you doing?

_This is [a now page][now]. If you have your own site, [you should make
one][now], too._

When Twitter first arrived on the scene, it had one mission: answer the
question, "What are you doing?" Twitter no longer serves that purpose for most
of its users, and as such, a better place to keep up with me is to watch this page.

This is what I'm doing as of May 4, 2021.

## 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦<small style="font-size: 0.6rem">👧🏾</small> &nbsp;Family

I live in Burleson, Texas (just south of Fort Worth) with my wife and three kids.
Working from home for the past several years has been a huge blessing; I've been
able to be there for the big moments and the tough times. I'm able to greet my
kids when they come home from school and help them with various things throughout
the day. The random hugs and surprise meeting crashes are always fun.

## 👨‍💻 &nbsp;Work
I'm currently happily employed as a Lead Software Engineer at [Stitch
Fix][stitchfix]. It's a fantastic place to work: competitive compensation,
interesting challenges to solve with a great deal of autonomy, great benefits,
and a serious commitment to life/work balance.

I work remotely keeping our payment systems running smoothly, which is not as
boring as it sounds. (And [we're hiring][careers], by the way.)

## ⛪️ &nbsp;Church

I'm still the [youth leader][youth] at [Burleson Bible Church][bbc] where I
mentor and teach students in grades 7 through 12. I also serve in the music
ministry where I primarily play bass guitar, but occasionally acoustic guitar,
electric guitar, and keyboard. I'm solidly mediocre at every instrument I play.
Except drums. I'm actually just bad at those.
