        Hi, there! This is my website. I'm a Christian, husband to my
        beautiful wife, and father to three wonderful kids. I make a living as a
        software engineer, solving business problems (sometimes with software).
        I've also taken a few [photos] that I'm proud of.

        If you're wondering what I'm currently up to, visit my [now page][now].
