I can't tell you how many times I've received a gift and meant to say thank you,
whether in person, over the phone, or with a note, and completely forgotten. By
not making a priority of letting them know their gift was appreciated, I am
being ungrateful. This is a sin that can easily slip into habit without notice.

Look at the lepers who were healed by Jesus on His way past Samaria in Luke
17:11-19. Ten men received miraculous healing, yet only one returned to give
thanks and praise to the One who healed him.

> [The ten lepers said,] “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” When he saw them he

> God except this foreigner?” And he said to him, “Rise and go your way; your
> faith has made you well.” 

**Your faith has made you well.** I think the interesting thing here is that
statement here is true of *all ten* men, not just the one who returned. They
were each given a gift, yet only one was marked by true gratitude. I like to
imagine that the other ten were indeed thankful, but they were so excited to be
healed that they ran off to the priests to get a clean bill of health, ran home
to hug their families, and carried on with their lives. It's like the kid on
Christmas morning who's so excited about his gift that he tears into it and
begins playing with it, but he's so preoccupied with the gift that he forgets to
show gratitude.

Jesus continues to show grace to the ungrateful, but the one who returns the
praise back to Him has a richer understanding of the grace he received. This
Thanksgiving I'm most grateful for the grace God has given me in every area of
life, even (especially?) the areas where He's growing me.
