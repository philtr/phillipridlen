        Hi, there! I'm a Ruby developer baking up awesome digital treats at [Oven
        Bits](http://ovenbits.com) in Dallas. I'm not interested in freelance work,
        but feel free to take a look at my [open source projects](/projects/). I
        co-organize [Ruby FTW](http://rubyftw.org), the Ruby enthuisast group of Fort
        Worth, which you (if you're located in the area) should definitely come it
        check out&mdash;we have free pizza!

      I'm also the youth director at [Burleson Bible Church](http://burlesonbible.org) for students in
      7th-12th grade. I apologize in advance for the fart jokes.

      On this site, youâ€™ll find an assortment of posts about
      programming, technology, Christianity, food, and life in general.

      The tech stack for this website includes:

        * [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), & [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to generate the site
        * [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) because I'm too lazy to do it myself
        * [Turbolinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks) for speedy page loads and client-side caching
        * [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) to deploy it to:
          * [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for static asset hosting
          * [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) as a distribution network for super-fast responses
        * [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) for continuous deployment

      The type should be set in [your system UI font][system-ui].
