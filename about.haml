        Hi, there! I'm a software engineer weaving code at [Stitch
        Fix](http://stitchfix.com). Before that I was baking up awesome digital
        treats at [Oven Bits](http://ovenbits.com) in Dallas.

        I co-organize [Ruby FTW](http://rubyftw.org), the Ruby enthuisast group
        of Fort Worth, Texas, which you (if you're located in the area) should
        definitely come it check out&mdash;we have free pizza!

        I occasionally [write a note or two](/notes/) on topics I'm passionate
        about. I'm also the youth director at [Burleson Bible
        Church](http://burlesonbible.org) for students in 7th-12th grade. I
        apologize in advance for the fart jokes.
