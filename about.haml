    Hi, there! On this site, you'll find an assortment of posts about programming, Christianity, food,
    and life in general.

  I'm a Ruby developer baking up awesome digital treats at [Oven Bits](http://ovenbits.com) in
  Dallas. I'm not interested in freelance work, but feel free to take a look at my [open source
  projects](/projects/). I organize [Ruby FTW](http://rubyftw.org), the Ruby enthuisast group of
  Fort Worth, which, if you're located in the area, should definitely come check out&mdash;we have
  free pizza!

  I'm also the youth director at [Burleson Bible Church](http://burlesonbible.org) for students in
  7th-12th grade. I apologize in advance for the fart jokes.

  The tech stack for this website includes:

    * [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), & [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to generate the site
    * [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) because I'm too lazy to do it myself
    * [Turbolinks](https://github.com/rails/turbolinks) for speedy page loads and client-side caching
    * [s3_website](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website) to deploy it to:
      * [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for static asset hosting
      * [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) - distribution network for super-fast responses
    * Zero self-managed server infrastructure (also because I'm lazy)

  The type is set in [Freight Sans](http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/freight_sans) and
  [Chaparral](https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1717).

  My preferred Bible translation is the [English Standard Version](http://www.esv.org/), although
  the [Lexham English Bible](http://lexhamenglishbible.com/) intrigues me as one staying as close to
  the original language text as possible.

  I also exist elsewhere on the internet:

    * Code on [GitHub](https://github.com/philtr)
    * "Designs" on [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/philtr)
    * Tweets on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/philtr)
