This repository contains the source for <https://phillipridlen.com>.
It is built with [Nanoc](https://nanoc.app) and a handful of custom
helpers.

## Running Locally

1. Install Ruby 3.4 and Bundler.
1. Run `bundle install` to fetch the gems.
1. Copy `env.example` to `.env` and add FreshRSS and Linkding settings
   (assuming you have something like [direnv] installed)
1. Use `bundle exec nanoc live` to start a local server or
   `bundle exec nanoc compile` to generate the static files.

## Running Tests

Tests use RSpec. To run the test suite:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```

This command will execute the tests located under the `spec/` directory.
