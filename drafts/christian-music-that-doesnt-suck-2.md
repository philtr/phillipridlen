Opening with a beautiful classical guitar and quickly building into
distorted guitar swells and pounding drums, _Beautiful Things_ doesn't
politely ask for your attention. It _demands_ it.

Some great insights from the [Gungor website][gungor_bio]:

> As Gungorâ€™s idea of God changed, so did his idea of church, so
> he and his wife moved to Denver and eventually founded a community
> of believers called Bloom. The connection between worship and
> social justice became concrete in Denver, and the outcome is
> evident on _Beautiful Things_. Ironically, most of the music is not
> directly about caring for the poor and ministering to widows and
> orphans. Instead, much of the album addresses the spiritual journey
> and the understanding of God that happens when we do these acts.

For me, the low point on this album is "Heaven," featuring Israel
Houghton and his signature gospel fusion style. In the context of this
beautiful album, that's not a good thing.

That being said, this album is chock-full of original, worshipful tunes
that move me more with each listen. It should not be missing from your
collection.
