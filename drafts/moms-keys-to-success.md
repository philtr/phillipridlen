I owe every accomplishment I ever achieved to three things my mom instilled in me: flexibility, creativity, and ingenuity.

1. Flexibility

I consider being open to change one of my best qualities. If someone needs to reschedule a meeting, no problem. Adapting to the workflow of  others is easy and nearly effortless. And besides the benefit to others, being flexible keeps my optimism alive. 

2. Creativity

Even if my drawings were bad or I sang off-key, my mom has always encouraged me to be creative instead of being merely a consumer. By turning off the TV and "forcing" me to draw a picture or practice an instrument, she fostered a love of those things that are essential in more areas than I could even imagine. 

3. Ingenuity

My mom never forced me to clean my room a certain way. It was my responsibility to get it done, but the means of accomplishment were never specifically prescribed.
