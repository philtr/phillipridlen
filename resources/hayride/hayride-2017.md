### Glory to God Forever

Before the world was made  
Before You spoke it to be  
You were the King of kings  
Yeah, You were, yeah, You were  
  
And now You're reigning still  
Enthroned above all things  
Angels and saints cry out  
We join them as we sing  
  
Glory to God, glory to God  
Glory to God, forever  
Glory to God, glory to God  
Glory to God, forever, yeah  
  
Creator God, You gave  
Me breath so I could praise  
Your great and matchless name  
All my days, all my days  
  
So let my whole life be  
A blazing offering  
A life that shouts and sings  
The greatness of our King  
  
Glory to God, glory to God  
Glory to God, forever  
Glory to God, glory to God  
Glory to God, forever  
  
Take my life and let it be  
All for You and for Your glory  
Take my life and let it be Yours  
  
We sing  
  
Glory to God, glory to God  
Glory to God, forever  
Glory to God, glory to God  
Glory to God, forever

### Rejoice

Come and stand before your Maker  
Full of wonder, full of fear  
Come behold His power and glory  
Yet with confidence draw near  
  
For the one who holds the heavens  
And commands the stars above  
Is the God who bends to bless us  
With an unrelenting love  
  
Rejoice, come and lift your hands and  
Raise your voice, He is worthy of our praise  
Rejoice, sing of mercies of your King  
And with trembling, rejoice  
  
We are children of the promise  
The beloved of the Lord  
Won with everlasting kindness  
Bought with sacrificial blood  
  
Bringing reconciliation  
To a world that longs to know  
The affections of a Father  
Who will never let them go  
  
Rejoice, come and lift your hands and  
Raise your voice, He is worthy of our praise  
Rejoice, sing of mercies of your King  
And with trembling, rejoice  
  
All our sickness, all our sorrows  
Jesus carried up the hill  
He has walked this path before us  
He is walking with us still  
  
Turning tragedy to triumph  
Turning agony to praise  
There is blessing in the battle  
So take heart and stand amazed  
  
Rejoice, when you cry to Him He hears  
Your voice, He will wipe away your tears  
Rejoice, in the midst of suffering  
He will help you sing  
  
Rejoice, come and lift your hands and  
Raise your voice, He is worthy of our praise  
Rejoice, sing of mercies of your King  
And with trembling rejoice  
  

### This is Amazing Grace

Who breaks the power of sin and darkness  
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings  
  
Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder  
And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings  
  
This is amazing grace  
This is unfailing love  
That You would take my place  
That You would bear my cross  
You lay down Your life  
That I would be set free  
Oh, Jesus, I sing for  
All that You've done for me  
  
Who brings our chaos back into order  
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter  
The King of Glory, the King of Glory  
  
Who rules the nations with truth and justice  
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance  
The King of Glory, the King above all kings  
  
This is amazing grace  
This is unfailing love  
That You would take my place  
That You would bear my cross  
You lay down Your life  
That I would be set free  
Oh, Jesus, I sing for  
All that You've done for me  
  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain  
Worthy, worthy, worthy  
Oh  
  
This is amazing grace  
This is unfailing love  
That You would take my place  
That You would bear my cross  
You lay down Your life  
That I would be set free  
Oh, Jesus, I sing for  
All that You've done for me  

### Man of Sorrows

Man of Sorrows, Lamb of God  
By His own betrayed  
The sin of men and wrath of God  
Has been on Jesus laid  
  
Silent as He stood accused  
Beaten, mocked, and scorned  
Bowing to the Father's will  
He took a crown of thorns  
  
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  
  
Sent of heaven, God's own Son  
To purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones  
Who nailed Him to that tree  
  
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  
  
Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  
Now the curse of sin  
has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free,  
oh is free indeed! (x2)  
  
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  
  
See, the stone is rolled away  
Behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah, God be praised  
He's risen from the grave!  
  
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"  
Praise and honour unto Thee  
Praise and honour unto Thee
