This is a in [my previous post] about using [s3_webiste] to deploy my site to S3 and CloudFront. One
of the things I didn't like about that setup was the fact that I couldn't just edit a file on GitHub
and have my site updated and deployed in relatively real time. I've since taken a few steps to
enable that, and along the way I also added some unit tests and spell checking for posts.

#### Continuous deployment with CircleCI

#### Unit testing with RSpec and Aspell
