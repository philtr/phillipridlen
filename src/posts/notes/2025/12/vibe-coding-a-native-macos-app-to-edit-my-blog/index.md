title: Vibe coding a native macOS app to edit my blog
type: note
---
I have an awesome new editor for my website. It’s a native macOS SwiftUI app
that I can boot up on my Mac and write and edit posts. I don’t know Swift. And I
don’t know the SwiftUI API. To me this is the perfect candidate for blind vibe
coding. It’s a totally offline, unsupported app that improves my quality of life
and inspires me to write, because it feels… well, it just feels _good_.

It’s not perfect. And I have lots of ideas for improvements. It will just keep
getting better and better. If you’re interested, you can look at the source [in
the `macos/BlogAdmin` folder of the repo for this
site](https://github.com/philtr/phillipridlen/tree/master/macos/BlogAdmin).
