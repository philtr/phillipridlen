I want to write, more but I'm not sure what to write about. My [blog] is all
over the place and lacks a singular focus, because my interests are varied and
lack a singular focus. Some ideas I've had over the years:

- Christianity, both theology and the practical outworkings of that theology
- Programming
- Music or musical instruments and musicianship
- Apple products
- Tasting delicious food and trying new restaurants and recipes
- Traveling together with my family

However, if you'll notice, nothing's been posted on this blog since January of
2018—nearly three years! I've discovered I like the idea of writing more than I
acutally enjoy writing. There is a certain romance to the idea of being able to
sit down and write a thousand—or five thousand—words that eloquently string
together a point that simultaneously resonates with and challenges my audience.
There is a reality check than needs to happne here. In high school and college,
I had difficulty writing more than a few thousand words on topics I'd thoroughly
reasearched and was passionate about. I'm not sure how I expect myself to be
able to wirte that on topics in which I have much less knowledge and expertise.

As an effort to unstick myself, I'm going to be OK with writing things that
never get published. I'm going to be OK with writing things that only consist of
a few hundred or even a few dozen words. The idea is that the more I do it, the
more I make a habit out of putting my thoughts to pen and paper (or pixels and
bits), the more I will feel comfortable expressing my ideas, interests, and
expertise in written word.

I want to say, "expect many more new blog posts from me in 2021." But I know how
that has gone in the past, with interest waning with the moon and passion for
writing fizzling out. And that's okay, too. I sit behind a drumset every few
weeks to remind myself how difficult it is and how I'm more in love with the
idea of playing drums than I am with putting in the hard work and effort to
learn to play them well. Perhaps this will be a catalyst for writing more, but
it may also be a "sitting behind the drumset" moment.
