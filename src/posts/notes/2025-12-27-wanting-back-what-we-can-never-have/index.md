On any given September afternoon in the late 1990s, you might find me racing
home from school on my bicycle. I was overweight, and not a particularly strong
cyclist. The way to my house from Sheridan Green Elementary (which, I learned
recently, was
[demolished and will soon be replaced with a city park](https://www.westminsterwindow.com/news/government-politics/article_715ec394-a453-4afb-8fc1-c5f8e3d14b37.html))
was mostly flat, until you got to the hill on 112th Place, which didn't really
look much at all like a hill until you tried to ride your bike up it, and, upon
reaching the summit, you found yourself out of breath and your legs all wobbly.

  It was *mostly* flat.

After catching my breath, greeting my mom, and having a quick snack, I'd ask
permission to use our family's phone line to connect to the internet to check my
email and play an online match of _Age of Empires_, firing up our trusty 56K
dial-up modem connected to the family computer. The «familiar screech of the
modem making contact» with the digital universe was like the secret knock on the
door to a magical world, where nothing was impossible. It was the Information
Age, and we optimistically looked forward to the dawning of a new millennium
that would keep us more informed, more connected, more efficient, than ever
before.

  «The internet followed me out of the family room and into my
  pocket.»

The internet kept getting better. Our connections kept getting faster. First, we
installed a dedicated second phone line in our house so we wouldn't tie up the
line for phone calls. Before long, we had DSL. I could download a song from
[mp3.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20020531114503/http://mp3.com/) in mere
minutes, not hours. ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger connected me to school and
church friends, but also my friends from around the world. I had several guys I
chatted with often whom I had met on a youth group mission trip. The
[opening door sound](https://www.myinstants.com/en/instant/door-open-aim-93903/)
of my friends coming online gave a rush of excitement—I didn't even have to
leave my room or stop what I was doing to talk to my friends.

Slowly, the center of social life faded from schools, clubs, and churches—it was
now Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter. My addiction became asynchronous, scrolling
for the next cool post while waiting for the reactions and comments on my own.
Before I knew it, and with my full consent, «the internet followed me out of the
family room and into my pocket» with the advent of the smartphone, which acted
as an accelerant for all the best—and worst—things the internet had to offer. I
didn't stop to consider the consequences.

<figcaption>
  It was the Information Age, but we didn't stop to consider the consequences.
</figcaption>

The Information Age failed to deliver on its promise. The flood of news,
awareness, and connection around the world combined with addiction only led to
more anxiety and more wasted time. Keeping up with every latest news story,
every current internet trend and meme, has become increasingly exhausting. Those
entering adulthood right now have never known a world without an omni-present
high-speed connection to _anything and everything_. They've never tasted the
ancient peace of living offline.

It didn't feel remarkable at the time. The boredom, the freedom to let your mind
wander without constant digital input. Scanning magazine covers and candy bars
in the grocery store checkout line. Waiting for your favorite television program
to come on the air. It all just felt _normal_. And now that peace is gone.

<figcaption>It is tempting to give into the nostalgia.</figcaption>

I often catch myself wishing for that earlier version of the internet—the one I
could more easily log off, go outside, wonder, and be bored, and despite
technically being less connected, felt more real and satisfying. It is tempting
to give in to the nostalgia. But here's the deal: those times can't come back.
And maybe they _shouldn't_. «The world is too connected, too efficient, too
transparent now.» There's no going back. No matter how much we long for the days
of intermittent connection, the ship is too large to steer.

But beyond that, here's the question that scares me most: _What if the peace and
slower pace of life I remember from my childhood never really existed in the
first place?_ As we age, we look on the past with rose-colored glasses. The past
seems simpler now, but it was fraught with its own anxiety. Got stranded on the
side of the road in the middle of nowhere? Hope that a car passes by, is willing
to stop, and is not a serial killer. We had to rely on the details that the news
media felt were important, unable to do our own research. If you had an unusual
hobby, it was more difficult to find others who shared your interests.

<figcaption>Counting on the kindness of strangers.</figcaption>

And if I'm being truly honest, I never really lived that slower pace. It's a
false memory of a time before my own. The internet grew up with me, and I grew
up with the internet. I was relatively young when the internet became
ubiquitous, and I was still in college when I got my first smartphone.

There's also some good in that connection. It pays my salary, yes—but there are
tangible benefits to having the wealth of the knowledge of humanity at your
fingertips. I don't have to brave the busy aisles of a grocery store and wonder
if they'll have what I need in stock. I can order replacement parts for my home
appliances and have them arrive in the mail within a day or two, at half the
cost of the manufacturer's part. I can purchase a book and be reading it on my
tablet within seconds.

I don't think what I _really_ miss is the alien sounds of the dial-up modem or
waiting for my computer to boot up as the spinning hard drive skipped across bad
sectors. I think what I miss is the boundaries and constraints that came
naturally with the limitations of the technology. Boundaries between the real
and digital world, and boundaries between contexts. It all collapsed into one–
«work, family, news, entertainment, faith, and politics, all on the same screen
in the same feed.» The boundaries gave life rhythm and meaning, intentionality
and purpose, and now daily life has been reshaped at its foundation.

<figcaption>
  We have to take control of the technology so it does not take control of us.
</figcaption>

Where do I go from here? Grieving the loss of what we once had is the first step
to moving on. We have to understand the new foundation for living in the digital
world, and define the way we will use that technology rather than letting it
define us. We have to take control of the technology so it does not take control
of us.

We need to establish rhythms of life that bring us in and out of the online
world. Weekly events like church, clubs, workout groups, or neighborhood
barbecues can pull us out of our digital haze and foster the offline connection
we crave.

Maybe it's OK to keep your world small. Maybe it's OK to ignore the news
headlines and political ranting on social media. Maybe it's better to let
friendships drift apart when you move away rather than try to keep up with it
all.

As for me? Being mindful of my screen time and using apps that nudge me in the
right direction[^1] has palpably increased my satisfaction and enjoyment of both
my family time and computing time. I'm going to put down my phone and make the
world a little smaller.

    Currently, I'm using [Be Present](https://www.bepresentapp.com/). It has a
    huge advantage over iOS's built-in ScreenTime controls, and for me, it
    strikes the right balance of restriction and flexibility. In the last month,
    I've reduced my smartphone usage by over 50%. If you're looking for
    something to encourage healthy screen time habits, check it out! This is how
    we reclaim peace and sanity as culture.
