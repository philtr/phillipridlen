Adam Murray, in an [interview with The Gospel
Coalition](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/coding-for-the-kingdom):

> As an image-bearer of God, how does your work reflect some aspect of God’s work?

That you're building something from basically nothing has long been my favorite
thing about programming. I've never thought about how it ties in with Genesis in
God's act of creating the universe _ex nihilo_. Every time we start a new
project or feature, we have the opportunity to bring glory to the First Creator.
