I reviewed _You Need a Budget_ by Jesse Mecham [on Amazon][ynab]:

> While I am a huge fan of the YNAB product, and have been using it actively for
> several years, I half expected this book to be a thinly veiled advertisement
> to purchase his tool and convert to a paying customer. Mecham only mentions
> YNAB in passing as part of the real life examples, and puts a link to it in
> the appendix.
>
> This is not a book about how to use YNAB. This is a book to convince you first
> that the budgeted life is a better life, and secondly that a budget is
> something YOU can do.
>
> Mechamâ€™s Four Rules are presented in plain English using words that anyone can
> understand. These four rules really get to the heart of why You Need A Budget.
> Other financial advice will tell you what and how, YNAB is focused on the why
> (with a little bit of how).
>
> Even though I was already familiar with the Four Rules, reading this book gave
> me a renewed vision and helped me realize I was looking at my budget as a
> "what," but I needed to examine the "why".
