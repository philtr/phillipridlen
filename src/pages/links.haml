%section.posts
  %p.intro
    Links to articles, videos, and other things I've found interesting. A link
    here is not necessarily an endorsement.

  %ul.posts-list
    - links_sorted_by_date.each do |link|
      %li
        â˜…&nbsp;
        %a{href: link[:url]}= link[:title]
        %aside
          - date = Time.parse(link[:published])
          %time{datetime: date.iso8601, title: date.strftime("%A, %B %-d, %Y at %H:%M:%S %p")}
            = date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
