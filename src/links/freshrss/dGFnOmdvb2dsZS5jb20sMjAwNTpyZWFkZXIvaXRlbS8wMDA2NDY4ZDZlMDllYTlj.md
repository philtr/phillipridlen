<p><i>One of a few categories of yaks I steadfastly refuse to shave (but the temptation mounts!).
</i></p><p>It’s that time of year again, when I am wishing desperately that there were good alternatives to <abbr title="You Need a Budget">YNAB</abbr> for zero-based budgeting software — preferably with genuinely great native Mac and iOS apps. There are, as far as I can tell, <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>I have evaluated the alternatives. Scoured the subreddits! Monarch is<span data-sanitized-class="push-double"></span> <span data-sanitized-class="pull-double">“</span>what if Mint had figured out how to be nice and done some genuinely useful things?” EveryDollar is<span data-sanitized-class="push-double"></span> <span data-sanitized-class="pull-double">“</span>what if <abbr>YNAB</abbr> were worse and also gave money to a guy I find rather distasteful?” Actual went open-source and is therefore now actually maintained, but I don’t trust their hosting to exist long-term and don’t want to run my own.</p>
<p>Lunch Money looks like it gets close, and I may even give it a try, <em>and</em> I like that it’s a small company, but it’s also hard to tell what their prospects are of being here in five years. (<abbr>YNAB</abbr>: will be here in five years. I just may be five years more annoyed.) Everything else seems to be aimed at dumbing things down or is… let’s go with <em>not to my taste or standards</em> design-wise.</p>
<p>That net of all of that is basically: «sigh»</p>
