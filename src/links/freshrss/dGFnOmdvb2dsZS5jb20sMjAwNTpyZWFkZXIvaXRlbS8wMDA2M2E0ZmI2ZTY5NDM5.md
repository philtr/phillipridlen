<div data-sanitized-class="trix-content">
  <div>There was a tiny fly right by the drain, and I was about to wash my hands.<br><br>Turning on the water would have sent it right down the hole. A quick end, or an eventual struggled drowning, hard to know. But that would be that, there was no getting out.<br><br>Somehow, for a moment, I slipped into contemplation. I could just turn on the water, I could rescue it, I could use a different sink. Had I not even seen the fly, the water would already been on, its invisible fate secured.<br><br>But in that moment of maybe, the fly launched and flew away.<br><br>Since it didn't know what I was about to do, and what that would do to it, it had absolutely no idea how lucky it was.<br><br>And then I wondered. How often am I in that same position? No idea how lucky I am.<br><br>Often, probably always.<br><br></div><div>-Jason</div>
