Then, I’ll give my take.</p><hr><h3 data-sanitized-id="what-the-left-is-saying">What the left is saying.</h3><ul><li><strong>The left is mixed on the strikes, with many calling it a lawless escalation by Netanyahu. </strong></li><li><strong>Others say Israel gradually weakened Iran to the point where it could conduct such an attack. </strong></li></ul><p><strong>In Common Dreams, Juan Cole said </strong><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/israel-iran-international-law?ref=readtangle.com"><strong><u>Trump “must condemn — not support — this brazen and unlawful military campaign.</u></strong></a><strong>” </strong></p><p>“Netanyahu launched the strikes to thwart the peace negotiations being conducted with Iran by President Donald J. Trump’s administration via Oman, striking a day before the next talks were scheduled to take place. Trump had signaled repeatedly that he did not want the Israelis to attack, but Netanyahu appears to hold to the TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) theory of the president’s behavior. He pointedly thanked Trump in his address to the nation, clearly hoping that Iran might take some action against America in response and so draw Trump into a war he clearly does not want,” Cole wrote. “Ironically, Trump himself paved the way to this war by trashing the 2015 nuclear deal concluded by the UN Security Council with Iran, which effectively blocked Iran from ever militarizing its program.”</p><p>“Netanyahu was likely to some extent wagging the dog with this attack, since his governmental coalition is in danger of falling apart over the issue of the conscription of Ultra-Orthodox Jews, most of whom support Netanyahu,” Cole said. “A war with Iran is therefore Netanyahu’s double attempt to thwart the outbreak of peace between Iran and the U.S. and to thwart attempts to bring his government down domestically through a vote of no confidence… It is, however, unlikely that Israeli attacks can do more than set back Iran’s uranium enrichment program, since the country has a big establishment by now of nuclear scientists and it has its own uranium, and the know-how it has built up cannot likely be extinguished.”</p><p><strong>In The Atlantic, Graeme Wood wrote about </strong><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/why-israel-struck-now/683161/?ref=readtangle.com"><strong><u>“why Israel struck now.”</u></strong></a></p><p>“Israel has been contemplating an attack like this for two decades. Why was last night different from every other night? Israel claims that Iran was in a late-stage rush to assemble a nuclear weapon (‘nine atomic bombs,’ Netanyahu said). That claim is nearly unverifiable, but it’s worth noting general trends that might have made Iran’s decision to go imminently nuclear more likely,” Wood said. “For at least two decades, the decision to go nuclear has been political rather than technical. Iran had the know-how. Its leaders just needed to decide that a nuclear bomb was worth the risk. And recently the calculation around that decision has shifted.”</p><p>“Why, then, did Iran not make a mad rush for a nuclear weapon? Because it already had the immunity that a nuclear weapon would confer — and because as long as it didn’t have a nuclear weapon, it could use its threat of getting a bomb to extract concessions from America and its allies,” Wood wrote. “Circumstances have changed, and the country that changed them is Israel. It did so by piercing that immunity repeatedly, by attacking Iranian soldiers abroad, by humiliating and killing Iran’s proxies, and most of all by attacking it openly on its own hitherto sacrosanct territory. The Axis of Resistance wobbled, and by failing to do anything to steady it, Iran largely lost its deterrent power.”</p><hr><h3 data-sanitized-id="what-the-right-is-saying">What the right is saying.</h3><ul><li><strong>The right is also mixed on the attack, though many commend Israel for taking preemptive action to defend itself. </strong></li><li><strong>Others express concern that the U.S. will be pulled into another Middle East war.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>The New York Post editorial board wrote </strong><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/12/opinion/israel-is-serving-the-entire-world-taking-huge-risks-to-stop-iran-from-going-nuclear/?ref=readtangle.com"><strong><u>“Israel is serving the entire world — taking huge risks to stop Iran from going nuclear.”</u></strong></a></p><p>“Good for Israel, acting as it has before (the 1967 war, the takedown of Saddam Hussein’s nuclear program in 1981 and strikes on Syria in 2007) to preempt a clear existential threat to its continued existence,” the board said. “No serious player on the world stage can honestly deny that Tehran has been on its final run gaining nuclear weapons, and while some will quibble about whether the regime intended to use nukes to destroy ‘the Little Satan’ (as it has now called Israel for five decades), Jerusalem could hardly afford to take the chance.”</p><p>“Tehran will hit back hard, and the IDF can’t be remotely confident it will intercept every drone and missile as it has the last two times. Israel must expect to hurt, hoping that the pain is survivable and simply the necessary price for fending off extinction. The rest of the Middle East, indeed the world, gets to free-ride on Israel’s bold self-defense: The IDF is moving to take out what would’ve been a menace to everyone else, including those foolish enough to think Iran is an ally,” the board wrote. “Iran’s strategy failed; we can only pray that Israel’s strikes do everything they need to.”</p><p><strong>In The American Conservative, Jude Russo argued </strong><a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/this-is-not-our-war/?ref=readtangle.com"><strong><u>“this is not our war.”</u></strong></a></p><p>“It’s difficult to escape the sense that it didn’t have to be this way. The U.S.–Iran dealmaking process had shown promise at various points, and it remains obscure what changed between then and now,” Russo said. “What will happen next? I doubt that anyone at this point will openly say that the U.S. should commit to an increased troop presence in the Middle East to support Israeli operations against the Islamic Republic; Donald Trump in particular knows that a fresh ground war is political poison. No, we’ll start with air support, and maybe some bunker-busters, because, for all its vaunted military-industrial base, somehow Israel just can’t make a bunker-buster big enough to get to those reactors.”</p><p>“And if we were to pursue regime-change, who would replace the ayatollahs? The shah, whose family’s police state was so hated that Khomeini seemed preferable? The [Mojahedin Organization of Iran’s] bizarre mix of Islamism and Marxism? A miraculous, autochthonous secular liberal democracy with Western-style human rights norms? None of these options seems both likely and desirable. Each would demand American support up to and including direct military intervention,” Russo wrote. “While the course we are on staves off the already distant prospect of Iranian hegemony, it will egg on Islamic terrorism and tempt hostile action on the sea lanes as Iran and its proxies seek leverage against their enemies. If the conflict is inevitable, the American message must be clear: This is not our war.”</p><hr><h3 data-sanitized-id="what-international-writers-are-saying">What international writers are saying.</h3><ul><li><strong>Some writers say Israel rightly seized an opportunity to attack a weakened adversary.</strong></li><li><strong>Others criticize Israel and the U.S. for further destabilizing the Middle East. </strong></li></ul><p><strong>In The Jerusalem Post, Yaakov Katz said </strong><a href="https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-857553?ref=readtangle.com"><strong><u>“Israel had a window of opportunity to attack Iran and it was right to use it.”</u></strong></a></p><p>“From a military perspective, there is little question that Israel was right to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities. It took advantage of a unique window of opportunity that stemmed from three primary factors. The first was the degradation of Iran’s regional proxies. For years, when the issue of attacking Iran would come up around the cabinet table, one of the main arguments against it was the retaliation Israel would face from Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and Iranian forces in Syria. That concern is no longer what it once was,” Katz wrote. “The second factor was operational capability — whether Israel can actually pull off such a strike… Penetrating fortified sites remains a challenge, but there is reason to believe Israel has the means.”</p><p>“The third factor was the change in Washington. While President Donald Trump said he preferred a diplomatic deal with Iran, negotiations have stalled… We now know that Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were coordinated and that the comments coming out of Washington, that a deal might still be possible, were part of a planned ruse to put the Iranians to sleep,” Katz said. “The window of opportunity needed to be used since it was not going to remain open indefinitely. The more time passes, the more Iran will rebuild — its air defenses, its proxies, and its offensive capabilities.”</p><p><strong>In Al Jazeera, Belén Fernández asked </strong><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/6/13/israel-strikes-iran-what-happened-to-america-first?ref=readtangle.com"><strong><u>“as Israel strikes Iran, what happened to ‘America First’?”</u></strong></a></p><p>“Israel, of course, thrives on perpetual upheaval and mass killing, all the while portraying itself as the victim of the folks it is slaughtering and otherwise antagonising. True to form, the Israelis have now cast Iran as the aggressor, with the country’s nonexistent nuclear weapons allegedly posing a ‘threat to Israel’s very survival,’” Fernández wrote. “Unlike Iran, Israel does happen to possess nuclear weapons — which just renders the whole situation all the more flammable. But for Netanyahu, at least, keeping the region in flames is a means of saving his own skin from domestic opposition and embroilment in various corruption charges.”</p><p>“By launching a so-called ‘preemptive strike’ on Iran, then, Israel has effectively preempted the prospect of any sort of peaceful solution to the issue of whether or not the Iranians should be permitted to pursue a civilian nuclear enrichment programme,” Fernández said. “And yet the at least tacit endorsement extended by Trump for today’s attacks on Iran would seem to call into question American priorities — and raise the possibility that the US is instead putting ‘Israel First.’”</p><hr><h3 data-sanitized-id="my-take">My take.</h3><p><strong>Reminder: “My take” is a section where I give myself space to share my own personal opinion.

For obvious reasons, this is a harrowing moment. Israel has clearly made the decision that now is the time to fight the big fight, and Netanyahu is focused on winning it quickly and decisively. But there are a lot of moving pieces, and every possible outcome is in play: Iran could be far weaker than we think, and Israel may bowl them over and open the door to a new regime in a matter of weeks. Iran could launch an effective counterattack and put Israeli citizens at risk. Alternatively, Iran could focus instead on attacking U.S. targets in the region to try to drag us into the war, and then drag their own allies in, bringing about the long-feared, protracted, all-out regional conflict — or global war. What will Saudi Arabia do? What about Turkey, or the UAE, or Europe? What will China do? What will Russia do? And what will we do? The ground is uncertain, and we’re all about to live through history.</li><li>A cascade of diplomatic failures spanning multiple administrations, in multiple countries, have all led up to this moment. Let’s start with Trump: His <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html?ref=readtangle.com"><u>decision</u></a> to pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (or “JCPOA,” or “Iran Nuclear Deal”) and failure to negotiate a new nuclear deal has positioned the United States on the outside looking in, taking away any leverage we could have had. But Biden and Obama both deserve some blame, too. Obama negotiated the JCPOA, which gave the U.S. some leverage but had <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-inspectors-access-any-site-iran-true/?ref=readtangle.com"><u>shortcomings</u></a> that may not have stopped Iran from continuing to build a bomb. Biden wasn’t able to negotiate a new deal, either, and of course nobody deserves more blame than Iran itself. The country’s leadership is <a href="https://x.com/houmanhemmati/status/1933326932072149382?ref=readtangle.com"><u>genuinely authoritarian</u></a> (that word gets thrown around so much it has lost meaning, but in this case applies), and Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has steadfastly refused to back off promises to wipe Israel off the face of the planet, which makes the situation a little more difficult to solve. At the same time, the so-called Islamic Republic has <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/iran/report-iran/?ref=readtangle.com"><u>delivered</u></a> poor living conditions and limited freedom to its own people. Credible intelligence has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/iaea-board-declares-iran-breach-non-proliferation-duties-diplomats-say-2025-06-12/?ref=readtangle.com"><u>consistently suggested</u></a> that Iran <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/israeli-military-says-intelligence-shows-iran-near-nuclear-point-of-no-return--xM1lEhysnkaZFp9rCCIl?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgAAeOb-tmn3rNMTX0oOGK7myNaYt5vDudMyg-JXJXesQID5f5fSAUOjjm4qcY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=684c2fc0&amp;gaa_sig=yJyc4cuFFH1FRv3LsPiD7zvbszkYwRNlDXXqgxOFrwUTJv9lSViBVrFk_3tF0n2o5Mebx0Cufq4lpgZCX1E1eA%3D%3D&amp;ref=readtangle.com"><u>continues to pursue</u></a> a nuclear bomb (while plotting other <a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/how-iran-plans-to-destroy-israel/?ref=readtangle.com"><u>military operations</u></a> against Israel), and the obvious implication of a despotic regime that wants to annihilate Israel pursuing a nuclear bomb makes the motivation for the recent attack as clear as day.</li><li>You <a href="https://www.readtangle.com/leaving-zionism-israel-gaza-hamas-isaac-saul/"><u>all know how I feel about Israel’s actions in Gaza</u></a>, but this is not the same story. This is a different front of a different war, and one where the existential threat to Israel is more obvious and intractable. Israel does not have a responsibility in Iran the same way it does in Gaza. As reductive and brutal as it is to say, <em>this</em> is the war Israel <em>should </em>have been fighting this whole time — against an enemy that is upstream of so much of the violence, division, hatred, and instability in the region. Of course, Israel’s claim to higher moral authority is not at all straightforward. The decision to conduct this attack was made by a corrupt and failed leader clinging to power who is, in my view, currently committing an ethnic cleansing in Gaza. So it’s understandably hard for a lot of people to empathize with Netanyahu or Israel right now; but it’s easy to ask, <em>what would you do? </em>What would you do if a nation developing nuclear weapons was promising to <a href="https://x.com/DGisSERIOUS/status/1933322263799189940?ref=readtangle.com"><u>wipe you off the face of the planet</u></a>, and you watched decades of diplomatic efforts fail to resolve the issue? Iran had a <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/irans-doomsday-clock-for-israels-end-halts-amid-power-cuts/amp/?ref=readtangle.com"><u>literal doomsday clock</u></a> in its capital city counting down the days to Israel’s destruction. Just this week, Iran <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea-sanctions-728b811da537abe942682e13a82ff8bd?ref=readtangle.com"><u>said</u></a> it had built and would activate a third nuclear-enrichment facility just hours after a watchdog agency <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea-sanctions-728b811da537abe942682e13a82ff8bd?ref=readtangle.com"><u>censured</u></a> Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations. President Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114675841423085927?ref=readtangle.com"><u>gave Iran</u></a> 60 days to make a deal, and it didn’t. Again, Iran is primarily responsible for forcing this issue.</li><li>The obvious counterpoint to all of this is <a href="https://www.readtangle.com/iran-nuclear-talks-trump-oman/#:~:text=In%20the%20past%2C%20I%E2%80%99ve%20been%20%E2%80%9Csupportive%20but%20skeptical%E2%80%9D%20of%20Iranian%20nuclear%20deals.%20Iran%20has%20been%20%E2%80%9Cweeks%20away%20from%20a%20bomb%E2%80%9D%20for%20most%20of%20my%20lifetime%2C%20and%20I%20can%20hardly%20stop%20myself%20from%20chuckling%20when%20I%20hear%20it%20again%2C%20now%2C%20in%202025."><u>my statement a few weeks ago</u></a>: Iran has been “weeks away from a bomb” for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/world/iran-may-be-able-build-atomic-bomb-5-years-us-israeli-officials-fear.html?ref=readtangle.com"><u>most of my lifetime</u></a>, and I can hardly stop myself from chuckling when I hear that claim again, now, in 2025. We’ve seen dramatic intelligence claims before, most infamously the false certainty around Iraq’s WMD program in 2003, and this historical context should make us skeptical about Iran’s nuclear capabilities. How credible is the latest intelligence, really, and how much are the reports about Iran’s nuclear capabilities really just a pretext for war? The U.S. says it has <a href="https://x.com/John_Hudson/status/1933371435239514274?ref=readtangle.com"><u>not changed its assessment</u></a> that, despite its enrichment efforts, Iran has not begun to transform enriched uranium into an actual nuclear weapon. Sitting as we are outside the immediate sphere of people with firsthand access to that intelligence makes it hard to know the truth. </li><li>What does this mean for Trump? Days ago the president was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/politics/trump-israel-iran-strike-us-diplomacy?ref=readtangle.com"><u>clearly telling Israel</u></a> not to instigate Iran. He has now <a href="https://x.com/jonkarl/status/1933483871422632218?ref=readtangle.com"><u>praised the attack</u></a> and affirmed the United States’ material support. Israeli sources <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/13/how-israel-executed-strike-iran-nuclear?ref=readtangle.com#:~:text=The%20intrigue%3A,officials%20now%20say."><u>claim</u></a> his public opposition to a strike was a disinformation campaign to intentionally mislead Iran into thinking a strike wasn’t coming, and Trump now says that he knew this was going to happen. Before, during and after the election, Trump has promised <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-promises-to-bring-lasting-peace-to-a-tumultuous-middle-east-but-fixing-it-wont-be-easy?ref=readtangle.com"><u>over</u></a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-promises-to-bring-lasting-peace-to-a-tumultuous-middle-east-but-fixing-it-wont-be-easy?ref=readtangle.com"><u>over</u></a> to reduce the American presence in the Middle East; and yet, the odds we get dragged into a new war just increased tenfold. Trump promised to end the war in Ukraine after 24 hours, and it is now more protracted than ever. Trump promised to end the war in Gaza before even getting to the White House, and his position is now <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-administration-working-plan-move-1-million-palestinians-libya-rcna207224?ref=readtangle.com"><u>an open plan</u></a> for ethnic cleansing. Trump has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/energy/iran-woos-trump-with-a-trillion-dollar-opportunity-will-a-nuclear-deal-make-america-rich-intl?ref=readtangle.com"><u>pursued</u></a> the ultimate trillion-dollar deal with Iran, but couldn’t land the plane, and Iran has now <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/5348689-iran-nuclear-deal-talks-suspended/?ref=readtangle.com"><u>pulled out</u></a> of negotiations. Netanyahu conducted this strike either with or without Trump’s approval, and neither option reflects well on the “president of peace” who just got done touring the Middle East promising to usher in an era of tranquility. </li><li>Not to be crass, but is Iran genuinely screwed? We know the regime credibly <a href="https://www.readtangle.com/iran-nuclear-talks-trump-oman/#:~:text=regime%20credibly%20believes%20it"><u>believed</u></a> it faced an existential threat <em>before </em>this attack. It is <a href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202302036145?ref=readtangle.com"><u>loathed</u></a> by many Iranians. It is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/middleeast/iran-response-israeli-strikes-intl-cmd?ref=readtangle.com"><u>weakened</u></a> in the region. It has not mustered <a href="https://x.com/Osinttechnical/status/1933484426106704332?ref=readtangle.com"><u>anything close</u></a> to a consequential response so far, and it did not seem at all prepared for this attack. Hezbollah has <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/hezbollah-official-says-it-will-stay-out-of-israel-iran-fight/?ref=readtangle.com"><u>said</u></a> it won’t respond to the attack, a genuinely shocking revelation for a fighting force Iran has been grooming for just this moment. And on top of that, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan have all allowed Israel to intercept Iranian rockets in their airspace — and Jordan has gone as far as to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/israel-iran-strike-conflict/card/jordan-intercepting-missiles-and-drones-in-its-airspace-23iXgh6DDeFb2FHgM2WC?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAglHNX5Sp34WWcqSWstBNbxeBe_43XkFmQrcq6MM2VdlEoeanAB8RE1xaDs2hc%3D&amp;gaa_ts=684c36c2&amp;gaa_sig=TXcyCDMKmGrac8PydoLiiDYEAuock59UEUlERaqMPnTxcZf41r84Y9cv8TAvue12U_nefp287NqB3VCzYUYECg%3D%3D&amp;ref=readtangle.com"><u>intercept some on its own</u></a>. Who are Iran’s allies that are willing to fight this war? What leverage does it currently have? How does it get out from under these attacks? I honestly don’t know. This might really be the beginning of the end of this regime. </li><li>In my view, this is the best possible <em>realistic</em> outcome: Iran’s response proves completely inadequate, and it becomes apparent quickly that they have been overwhelmed by Israeli military ingenuity and expertise. The regime falls or all of its top leaders are killed. The Iranian people take the opportunity to supplant them with a new, more moderate, less-interested-in-killing-Jews regime that actually decides to join the modern world and advance economic opportunity and freedom for its people (a path it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/gallery/2014/sep/10/iran-swinging-sixties-in-pictures?ref=readtangle.com"><u>seemed poised to take</u></a> decades ago). The millions of Iranians bearing the weight of this regime undertake a genuine revolution to finally dispel the regressive Islamic Revolution of 1979, retake the country, and remake it in their image. A new, moderate government in Iran allows Israel to draw its Arab partners closer without fear of existential reprisal, and the cascading effects open up opportunities for new leadership in Gaza and new relations with Lebanon, all of which bring us a few steps closer to long-term peace.</li><li>Here is what I think is the worst possible <em>realistic</em> outcome: Iran’s response is stronger than we expect, and it manages to seriously harm the Israeli military, kill Israeli civilians, and draw in members of the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-brics-group-and-why-it-expanding?ref=readtangle.com"><u>intergovernmental organization BRICS</u></a> (currently composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates) to begin attacking both Israeli and U.S. targets. President Trump decides he must respond to these attacks and joins Israel in the fight. Global powers — perhaps Russia or China — recognize the significance of the power centers in this region changing and come to Iran’s side, either in the form of kinetic or cyber warfare against the U.S. and its allies. This conflict spills into a global war that causes massive spikes in the price of energy, food, and goods; creates deadly knock-on effects that will require decades to recover from; and substantially increases the likelihood of a nuclear conflict. </li><li>If the best-case scenario happens, I’ll gladly tip my hat to one of my least favorite leaders in the world right now (Prime Minister Netanyahu) and excitedly cheer on the emergence of new dynamics in the region. If the worst-case scenario happens, we’ll have much, much bigger problems than anything I have to say. The most likely outcome is probably something between the two, and my initial reaction is to be much more concerned about the possible risks than excited about the potential benefits. </li><li>I will never be comfortable with the assassination of scientists, and Israel’s decision to target and kill the top nuclear scientists in Iran (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-fakhrizadeh-assassination-israel.html?ref=readtangle.com"><u>again</u></a>) is really hard for me to swallow — even if the rationale is clear. Images from Tehran of attacks in the <a href="https://x.com/farnazfassihi/status/1933425486195040282?ref=readtangle.com"><u>middle of residential neighborhoods</u></a> appear to be war crimes, and should be described as such. Civilians <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/world/middleeast/israel-iran-strikes.html?ref=readtangle.com"><u>have already died</u></a>, as they have in Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen — and in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crln9lk51dro?ref=readtangle.com"><u>wars</u></a> all <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/09/1154436?ref=readtangle.com"><u>across the globe</u></a>. This reality cannot be ignored or swept under the rug. Israel <a href="https://x.com/marcowenjones/status/1933432127582056877?ref=readtangle.com"><u>killed the person</u></a> who was <em>literally </em>leading the nuclear negotiations with the U.S. Just as frightening is what that means for where this is headed: Crossing this Rubicon makes every Israeli citizen fair game — if Israel can justify killing innocent Iranians as collateral damage in its targeting of scientists, then Iran is within its right to kill Israeli citizens while attempting to kill Israeli officials or leaders. Israel just opened that genie’s bottle, and we now have to deal with the repercussions.</li><li>At the same time, it’s also hard not to marvel at the brilliance of the Israeli military and the way this opening strike was conducted. Iran has been operating <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/06/why-israel-struck-now/683161/?ref=readtangle.com"><u>with a kind of immunity from direct strikes for years</u></a>, but the events of the last few months made its aura of untouchability less potent. Iran’s proxies are weakened. Its credible denials of being near a bomb are less convincing. Even its willingness to retaliate to a direct strike has been tested. So… Mossad planted agents on the ground who had been conducting clandestine preparations for months, and the Israeli intelligence service was able to set up explosives and drones near Iran’s ballistic missile launch sites and completely crippled its ability to launch retaliatory strikes against Israel. It acted lethally on intelligence about the locations of top scientists and generals. It leveled nuclear facilities. It crippled key airfields and military bases. It did all this in a manner of hours, and so far the operation seems to be going exactly according to plan.</li><li>Despite everything I’ve said above, I think it is still very much worth asking about Netanyahu’s motivations here (outside the obvious). Were Iran and Trump inching closer to a deal that Israel did not want? How close is Netanyahu’s governing coalition to falling apart? How desperate is he to conduct a war that will keep his right-wing allies in the Knesset happy? </li><li>While recording the Tangle podcast with Kmele and Ari yesterday, I expressed deep consternation at Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id8Jo0dXj1M&amp;ref=readtangle.com"><u>recent video</u></a> warning about nuclear war. It felt to me like she <em>knew something, </em>and I wondered aloud on the podcast what exactly that was. A few weeks ago, I expressed similar concern over Tucker Carlson’s <a href="https://www.readtangle.com/iran-nuclear-talks-trump-oman/#:~:text=Conservative%20pundits%20well%20sourced%20in%20the%20administration%2C%20including%20Tucker%20Carlson%2C%20seem%20deeply%20alarmed%20that%20we%20are%20barrelling%20toward%20an%20all-out%20war%20with%20Iran.%C2%A0"><u>warning</u></a> that this war was coming. It felt like he <em>knew something, </em>and I wondered what it was. I think it's pretty obvious these plans were percolating in certain circles. Now we’ll find out the next part: How bad will it get? Carlson, for example, <a href="https://x.com/AGHamilton29/status/1933334859872862489?ref=readtangle.com"><u>predicted</u></a> that a war with Iran would cause <a href="https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1901761608449216890?ref=readtangle.com"><u>thousands of Americans to be killed</u></a> in the first week, collapse our economy, spike gasoline to $30 a gallon, and ignite a world war that the United States would lose. I think contrasting predictions like this with the reality of what happens next will be important and worthwhile throughout the coming weeks.</li><li>Again: I don’t know what will happen next. And despite understanding the position Israel is in, and in many ways the necessity that motivated it to conduct these strikes, we have to extend that understanding to the Iranian people. Iran is a nation of 90 million civilians that will be reduced (in the Western media) to the actions of the regime whose thumb it lives under. We must remember the people there — the millions of normal people who want to be free from this regime, the random <a href="https://x.com/DudespostingWs/status/1933305817781997996?ref=readtangle.com"><u>kids like this</u></a> roaming the streets, the workers and students and families — and the devastation that war brings. My sincere prayer is for a quick end to these targeted attacks and, hopefully, new paths for peace throughout the region. I’m not optimistic, but I’m hopeful. </li></ol><p><em>Disagree? That's okay.
