While editing this video, I was hit with an overwhelming sense of gratitude for everyone who’s poured their time and energy into this project. We might be a bit crazy for taking it on—okay, more than a bit—but even with all the moments that this schoolhouse has made us lose our minds… it’s still SO worth it. 

What you don’t see in this video is all the behind-the-scenes help and support from our families and siblings. They’ve been here every step of the way and we never EVER would have taken on this daunting project without their blessings and excitement. From letting us live in their houses the last year with two wild toddlers, to babysitting, we are so deep in the hole of favors that we owe to our families… especially my dad. He gets extremely annoyed when I put him in Youtube videos but never in 1 million years could we have done this without his wisdom. 

Also just so incredibly grateful for all of the house renovation nerds out there that have been following along this last year or so. The comments, advice, and encouragement during the renovation doldrums has been such a surprising element of this project. 

Below are the amazing contractors we’ve used so far, if you’re looking for good folks in Central Indiana… they’re the best. If you're in the area and need someone's contact, please DM me at schoolhomestead@gmail(dot)com!

----------

* S&F Marble & Granite: Saul, Adolfo, Fernando, and Jason are the best. Truly a hidden gem of a place with incredible remnants. Watch my whole episode about them!

* Dave and Chris our painters- two more detailed and meticulous folks- they have painted my entire family’s houses + things for my parents business! (And my mom trusts no one with the details haha.)  

*Madison Street Salvage: an AMAZING little shop in our hometown of Franklin, Indiana. You never know what treasures you'll find and our little town of antique shops, cafes, and boutiques is definitely worth a trek! 

* Guardian Flooring Advancements: Kristen, Dave, and Micah run a tight ship and have been incredibly detailed for every layer of refinishing + putting in our new wood flooring. Can’t recommend them enough.

* B & E Masonry: Brad, E, and Brentley, Hez- Brad the mason is basically the king of the schoolhouse. For almost a year these guys worked on repointing the entire exterior of our school and then moved inside for repairs. 

* Breeden Electric: Shawn Breeden is a meticulous and thoughtful electrician. He worked on commercial buildings for many years running projects in Indianapolis and just started his own business.  

*Patton Plumbing: Mike and Jared and James have done our whole project, really love working with them! 

* Arrow Earth Services: Adam Yount and his team are the best. Adam is so thoughtful and considerate, and extremely quick and communicative.  

* Affordable Spray Foam Insulators: Fast, no-nonsense, and they do great work!!

* Specialty Concrete: Chance and Kenny helped us pour a new slab in our basement. Their team was super impressive and they are really lovely to work with.

* Chad Findley: Chad is our friend and he has been hanging all of the 100-year-old doors and doing trim around the school. He’s a perfectionist and I am so thankful he loves the creativity it takes to make things look alright in this wonky old building. 

* Greg Waltz: Greg is our lovely, meticulous, and incredibly kind tile guy. He has not once complained or been frustrated by the complicated tile plans I gave him.

* Dowty Construction: We used Pat's company to build our deck and I loved working with them! 

* Harmon Construction: Rob, Josh, and Jerry have been the backbone of a lot of interior things we’ve been doing from the school. They’ve been integral to everything we’ve done.

* Masonry by Mohler: Gaby and the Mohler crew of masons were SO slick and fast at getting our garage built! 

*HVAC guys: Derrick, Phil, Brandon, and Ricky-- even the inspector said to me, this work looks fantastic. 

* Schott Design: Emily Hillyer and the folks at Schott Design helped us get the final architectural plans and a lot of other details. So thankful we got to have some of Emily's wisdom!

* Smart Crawl: Craig Dukate and his team installed a French drain and waterproofed + insulated the underground basement walls!

* Robert D Young Construction: Colin, George, Hugo and their crew did all of our framing and drywall. They are beyond detailed, fair and I am so grateful to have their expertise on this project.  

* Tree Buddies: Robert Wilson and his team at Tree Buddies were the first folks we hired and they helped us with a TON of demo +cleanout.

* Quality Roofing Services: Greg Blatz and his team were fantastic to work with for our new roof.
