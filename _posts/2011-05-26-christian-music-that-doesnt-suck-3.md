This record of Fraser's is not labeled specifically as a Christian work,
but Fraser's work can be heard in churches across the country. She has
written beautiful congregational songs such as [Hosanna][hosanna]
(YouTube) for [Hillsong Church][hillsong] in Australia.

[Brian Palmer of _Glide Magazine_ says:][glide]

> Brooke Fraser’s third release, _Flags_, is a wonder. From the
> stunning lyrical imagery throughout to the impressive guest vocalists
> who join her [including Jon Foreman of Switchfoot], ... from
> Fraser’s ethereal and breathy performances to the wide-ranging
> soundscapes, this record is drenched in beauty and stands as one of
> the more remarkable achievements of 2010.

Be sure to check out her other releases, [_Albertine_][albertine] and
