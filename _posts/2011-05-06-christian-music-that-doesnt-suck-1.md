Excellent songwriting and musicianship. A step away from the glossy
production of mainstream worship music. Refreshingly raw and honest.

Josh White, formerly of [Telecast](http://www.becrecordings.com/artists/75/Telecast/) and
current pastor of [Door of Hope](http://www.doorofhopepdx.org) in
Portland, Oregon, tries his hand at writing meaningful, heartfelt
worship and succeeds in a huge way. Available on CD or vinyl.
