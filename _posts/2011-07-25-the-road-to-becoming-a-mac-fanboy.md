Great article written by Mike Elgan, former editor of _Windows Magazine_, on why he avoided switching
to a Mac:

> In my own case, I never really considered switching to Macs, or even using
them part time, for three reasons.

> First, I’m lazy. My skills, knowledge and habits around Windows were so deeply
ingrained that the idea of learning how to use a Mac sounded like a chore.

> Second, while I can fix a Windows PC no matter what’s wrong with it, I
wouldn’t know what to do if something broke on a Mac. I didn’t like the idea of
hauling the thing down to an Apple store and throwing myself at the mercy of
some “Genius.”

> Third, I had encountered so many hardcore fanboy haters in my career –
responding to my various columns with death threats, crazy, over-the-top
personal attacks and aggressive libel aimed at damaging my reputation by raising
questions about my professional integrity – that I just had a bad feeling about
joining the “other side.” Ninety-nine percent of Apple fans are very nice. But,
man, the insanely insane hardcore fringe is really something special.
