Not sure how I missed the whole [Telegram thing back in February][telegram-verge] when WhatsApp went
down. While nothing compared to WhatsApp's 600 million active users, Telegram's 50 million active
users each sending 20 messages a day with no money spent
on advertising is nothing to shake a stick at.

What intrigues me the most is that it is set up as a [non-commercial
organization](https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-are-you-going-to-make-money-out-of-this) promising to
never show ads or sell your data, along with the ability to send ["secret
chats"](https://telegram.org/faq#secret-chats) with end-to-end encryption--only the two devices in
question can read the message.

It's a cool initiative; I'm curious how this all is going to shake out as Facebook continues to pour
more money into Messenger and WhatsApp and vie for market share.

And please&mdash;feel free to [Telegram me](https://telegram.me/philtr) any time.
