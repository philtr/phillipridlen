title: Returning Multiple Formats with Dynamic Error Pages in Rails
published: true
---

Yesterday my coworker [Eric][eh] asked me to build out some dynamic
error pages for the upcoming version of one of our apps. He suggested a
certain pattern that we used in a previous application. Being the
adventurous soul that I am, I wanted to make sure his way was the
_best_ way. After some deep <s>soul</s> google searching, I found out that
Eric's method was considered best practice. It's described in some
detail on [Jos&eacute; Valim's blog post][hidden-rails-features], but I'll
break it down for you here:

First, we need a controller for our error pages. Start out with something
simple, like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
# app/controllers/errorrs_controller.rb
class ErrorsController < ApplicationController
  layout 'error' # only if you want a separate layout for your errors

  # 404 Not Found
  def not_found
  end

  # 422 Unprocessable Entity
  def unprocessable
  end

  # 500 Internal Server Error
  def internal_server
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's add some routes:

{% highlight ruby %}
YourApp::Application.routes.draw do
  match '/404', to: 'errors#not_found'
  match '/422', to: 'errors#unprocessable'
  match '/500', to: 'errors#internal_server'
end
{% endhighlight %}

With Rails 3.2, error pages have been extracted to a [Rack Middleware][mw].
Fortunately for us, so are the application routes. We can to tell rails to use
our routes app for the error pages in `config/application.rb`:

[mw]: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2257031/383950

{% highlight ruby %}
# config/application.rb
module YourApp
  class Application < Rails::Application
    # ...

    config.exceptions_app = self.routes
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

And that's it! Add some page templates in `app/views/errors/` and you
should be good to go.

To test it, we need to turn off the development mode error pages. Set
`consider_all_requests_local` to false in `config/environments/development.rb`:

{% highlight ruby %}
# config/environments/development.rb
YourApp::Application.configure do
  # ...

  config.consider_all_requests_local = false

  # ...
 end
{% endhighlight %}

You'll want to set that back to true before committing your code, or
else you won't receive any helpful feedback while developing your
application.

All of the above steps were fairly simple, but figuring out how to
determine which format to return is a little complex.
`env['REQUEST_PATH']` contains the error path (e.g. "/404") and no
format information is getting passed to the errors controller, so the standard
Rails `respond_to` stuff is not going to work here. We can grab the
original request path via `env['ORIGINAL_FULLPATH']`. I added a few
private methods to errors ontroller to help out. The first two help me
figure out what format the request came as. I want to return a JSON
respons if the request starts with '/api' or ends in '.json'. The third
will render our template in the format we want.

{% highlight ruby %}
class ErrorsController
  private

  def api_request?
    env['ORIGINAL_FULLPATH'] =~ /^\/api/
  end

  def json_request?
    env['ORIGINAL_FULLPATH'] =~ /\.json$/
  end

  def render_error(error)
    if api_request? or json_request?
      render "#{error}.json.jbuilder"
    else
      render "#{error}.html.haml"
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Now we just need to update the actions in our controller:

{% highlight ruby %}
class ErrorsController
  def not_found
    render_error "not_found"
  end

  def unprocessable
    render_error "unprocessable"
  end

  def internal_server
    render_error "internal_server"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

And we're done! Make sure you add your json templates to
`app/views/errors`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/nothing-here
{ error: "not_found" }
$ curl http://localhost:3000/nothing-here.json
{ error: "not_found" }
$ curl http://localhost:3000/nothing-here
<h1>404 Not Found</h1>
{% endhighlight %}
