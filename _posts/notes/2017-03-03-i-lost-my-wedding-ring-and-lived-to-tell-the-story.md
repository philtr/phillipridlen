I have a wedding ring in the Pacific Ocean somewhere.

No, it wasn't [some dramatic gesture][gob]. In fact, the story is not really that
interesting. We were in Puerto Vallarta for my brother's wedding a few years
ago, and my wife and I decided to go for an evening swim. I left my wedding ring
on because I didn't think it would fall off. It fell off. I never found it.

When I still had that original wedding ring, I was constantly afraid of losing
it or not knowing where it was. Losing the wedding ring was liberating, in a
way, because now I place more weight on the _meaning_ of the symbol on my finger
than the actual object itself.

The modern practice of men wearing a wedding band only really dates back about a
hundred years, and mostly due to increased advertising from the jewelry
industry.

All that aside, I wear the band for two main reasons. First, to remind myself
that I made a commitment to my wife. It's heavy, almost 18 grams. I notice it
when it's there, and I notice it when it's not there. Whether or or off, I'm
reminded of my commitment. And second, to proclaim my undying and unconditional
love for my wife to the rest of the world.

Divorce has never been an option, in my mind. I can't imagine doing life without
her. I only have one ring that I've replaced the wedding band with, but if I had
to replace it again, it wouldn't matter. Because it's not the ring itself that's
important, but the constant reminder of my commitment to her.
