title: Good vs. Best
---

A good reminder about setting your priorities wisely:

> Too often we're oblivious to the threat posed by the good things
> we're doing. We've laid down our defenses against the way the *good*
> can hinder the *best*. In this sense, good things can subtly and
> effectively become one of our worst enemies. ... We can fill our
> lives...with *good* things requiring our resources and *good*
> activities demanding our attention that are not ultimately *best*.
